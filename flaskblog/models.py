""" 
We start by adding something called the UserMixin to our User model. The UserMixin will add Flask-Login attributes to 
our model so Flask-Login will be able to work with it.

Then, we need to specify our user_loader. A user_loader tells Flask-Login how to find a specific user from the ID that 
is stored in their session cookie. 
We can add this in our create_app function along with basic init code for Flask-Login.


Usermixin (get_id) -> @login_manager.user_loader 

UserMixin class that has default implementationsthat are appropriate for most cases.
Usermixin has 4 methods (get_id is 1)
get_id: returns the id.
By specifying user_loader, we can query who the current login user is within database.
